### _Jeremiah LaRocco <jeremiah_larocco@fastmail.com>_

This project is for me to experiment with writing a barcode scanner "from scratch"  to teach myself how barcodes and barcode scanning works.

For "real" barcode scanning I'd suggest my [zbar bindings](https://github.com/jl2/zbar/) and [zbar-util library](https://github.com/jl2/zbar-utils/) instead.
